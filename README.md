# Decentralized AI Agent

Premises:
1. AI agents will be the future Web Browsers.
2. A successful AI agent could not strictly follow an organized agenda.
3. Failed proprietary browsers prove that second point.
4. Non-profit browsers also fail (IE- Mozilla's market share).
5. A successful AI agent would have to be sustainable (market-winning) and decentralized (Open Source).

What would that look like?
